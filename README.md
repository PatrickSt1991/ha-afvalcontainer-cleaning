# ha-afvalcontainer-cleaning  
Home Assistant integration for monitoring garbage container cleaning.  

Need to know when your garbage containers will be cleaned?  
This integration adds **sensors** to Home Assistant that track container cleaning schedules from supported services.  

Originally forked from [@xirixiz/homeassistant-afvalwijzer](https://github.com/xirixiz/homeassistant-afvalwijzer), this project shifts the focus from **waste collection dates** to **container cleaning services**.
