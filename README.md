# 🧼 Afvalcontainer Cleaning

<img src="https://madebypatrick.nl/assets/ha-cc-CUWVCUA3.svg" alt="clean container" width="400">

A **Home Assistant integration** for monitoring **garbage container cleaning schedules**.  

Need to know when your garbage containers will be cleaned?  
This integration adds **sensors** to Home Assistant that track cleaning services, so you’ll never miss a cleaning appointment again.  

---

## ✨ Features
- Adds `sensor.cleaningcontainer_*` entities in Home Assistant.  
- Tracks upcoming container cleaning schedules.  
- Supports multiple providers (see below).  
- Built with inspiration from [@xirixiz/homeassistant-afvalwijzer](https://github.com/xirixiz/homeassistant-afvalwijzer), but focused on **cleaning services** instead of **garbage collection**.

---

## 📦 Supported Providers
Currently, the integration supports the following providers/communities:

| Provider   |
|------------|
| **cleanprofs** |

> ⚠️ Availability depends on whether your municipality or service provider is supported and/or can be added.

🛠️ Created Sensors

Once configured, the following sensors are available:

sensor.cleaningcontainer_next → Date of next scheduled cleaning

sensor.cleaningcontainer_days_until → Days until the next cleaning

sensor.cleaningcontainer_last_update → Last time data was updated



---

📊 Example Lovelace Card

Here’s an example Entities card to display the sensors in your dashboard:

type: entities
title: Container Cleaning
entities:
  - entity: sensor.cleaningcontainer_next
    name: Next Cleaning
  - entity: sensor.cleaningcontainer_days_until
    name: Days Remaining
  - entity: sensor.cleaningcontainer_last_update
    name: Last Update

You can also use these sensors in automations (e.g., to send reminders before cleaning day).
